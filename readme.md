Simple Datavis Screensaver
==========================

The idea is simple: instead of looking at stupid screensavers that display some random graphics or images (ok, it might be art in some ways) one could display stupid data visualizations as well. One of the most stupid datasets I'm regularly looking at is the visitor statistics of my websites, so I thought this would be a perfect combination.
