Simple Datavis Screensaver
==========================

The idea is simple: instead of looking at stupid screensavers that display some random graphics or images (ok, it might be art in some ways) one could display stupid data visualizations as well. One of the most stupid datasets I'm regularly looking at is the visitor statistics of my websites, so I thought this would be a perfect combination.

Features
--------

The screensaver (the flash movie) will collect and visualize live data from various sources around the web. Currently supported data sources are

 * Piwik Web Analytics
 
Will add some more in the near future.

Currently included visualizations:

 * Line chart
 * Bar chart
 * Calendar heatmap
 * Single number
